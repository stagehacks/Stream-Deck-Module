# Stream Deck Module
 
Reference drawings and 3D files of the Stream Deck Module.

The Stream Deck Module is the inner assembly of the Stream Deck MK2. It includes the buttons, display, USB-C connector, and control circuity all in one unit. It's easy to mount in custom projects!

The module is accessed by removing the cover plate of the Stream Deck MK2. It's only held on with snaps, but they're very tight! [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ENbCPJs_Pw) from Elgato may be of help with removing the cover.

The module is not glued or fastened into the shell. Rather, it fits snugly into notches in the plastic form and is held in by the cover plate. After the cover plate is removed, the module should fall right out after a gentle shake.

When designing your own enclosure, it seems best to mount it the way Elgato did. Sandwich the module between two plates, being careful to only touch the outer few mm of the back of the module.
